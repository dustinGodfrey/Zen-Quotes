"\n\"Nothing stands still - everything is being born, growing, dying - the very instant a thing reaches its height, it begins to decline - the law of rhythm is in constant operations....\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"The lips of wisdom are closed, except to the ears of Understanding.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"Do not make the mistake of supposing that the little world you see around you - the Earth, which is a mere grain of dust in the Universe - is the Universe itself. There are millions upon millions of such worlds, and greater. And there are millions of millions of such Universes in existence within the Infinite Mind of THE ALL\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\""He who grasps the truth of the Mental Nature of the Universe is well advanced on The Path to Mastery.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"When the pupil is ready to receive the truth, then will this little book come to him, or her. Such is The Law. ...The Law of Attraction, will bring lips and ear together - pupil and book in company. So mote it be!\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"Everything flows out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"We have the truth still with us. But it is not found in books, to any given extent. It has been passed along......from lip to ear. When it was written down at all, its meaning was veiled in terms of alchemy and astrology, so that only those possessing the key could read it aright.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"The differences between different manifestations of Matter, Energy, Mind, and even Spirit, result largely from varying rates of Vibrations......the higher the vibration, the higher the position in the scale.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"Everything happens according to Law; that nothing ever\"merely happens\"; that there is no such thing as Chance; that while there are various planes of Cause and Effect, the higher dominating the lower planes, still nothing ever entirely escapes the Law.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"
"\n\"If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time trying to\"kill out\" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and the Fear will disappear.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion ~"

"\n3. The Principle of Vibration\n\n\"Nothing rests; everything moves; everything vibrates.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion."
"\n4. The Principle of Polarity\n\n\"Everything is Dual; everything has poles; everything has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes meet; all truths are but half-truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled.\"\n\n  ~ The Kybalion."
"\n5. The Principle of Rhythm\n\n\"Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum-swing manifests in everything; the measure of the swing to the right is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion."
"\n6. The Principle of Cause and Effect\n\n\"Every Cause has its Effect; every Effect has its Cause; everything happens according to Law; Chance is but a name for Law not recognized; there are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes the Law.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion."
"\n7. The Principle of Gender\n\n\"Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.\"\n\n ~ The Kybalion."

"\n\"Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"

"\n\"We have to recognize that the world is not something sculptured and finished, which we as perceivers walk through like patrons in a museum; the world is something we make through the act of perception.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"Culture is a perversion. It fetishizes objects, creates consumer mania, it preaches endless forms of false happiness, endless forms of false understanding in the form of squirrelly religions and silly cults. It invites people to diminish themselves and dehumanize themselves by behaving like machines.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"The main thing to understand is that we are imprisoned in some kind of work of art.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"The major adventure is to claim your authentic, true being, which is not culturally given to you. The culture will not explain to you how to be a real human being. It will tell you how to be banker, politician, Indian chief, masseuses, actress, whatever, but it will not give you true being.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"As the bonfires of knowledge grow brighter, the more the darkness is revealed to our startled eyes.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"What we call imagination is actually the universal library of what's real. You couldn’t imagine it if it weren’t real somewhere, sometime.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"Claim your place in the sun and go forward into the light. The tools are there; the path is known; you simply have to turn your back on a culture that has gone sterile and dead, and get with the programme of a living world and a re-empowerment of the imagination.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"You are an explorer, and you represent our species, and the greatest good you can do is to bring back a new idea, because our world is endangered by the absence of good ideas. Our world is in crisis because of the absence of consciousness.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"If the ego is not regularly and repeatedly dissolved in the unbounded hyperspace of the Transcendent Other, there will always be slow drift away from the sense of self as part of nature’s larger whole. The ultimate consequence of this drift is the fatal ennui that now permeates Western Civilization.\"\n\n ~ Terence McKenna ~"
"\n\"Our journey is about being more deeply involved in life, and yet less attached to it.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"       
"\n\"Don’t compare your path with anybody else’s. Your path is unique to you.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Souls love. That’s what souls do. Egos don’t, but souls do. Become a soul, look around, and you’ll be amazed-all the beings around you are souls. Be one, see one. When many people have this heart connection, then we will know that we are all one, we human beings all over the planet. We will be one. One love. And don’t leave out the animals, and trees, and clouds, and galaxies-it’s all one. It’s one energy.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"You've been somebody long enough. You spent the first half of your life becoming somebody. Now you can work on becoming nobody, which is really somebody. For when you become nobody there is no tension, no pretense, no one trying to be anyone or anything. The natural state of the mind shines through unobstructed - and the natural state of the mind is pure love.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Everything changes once we identify with being the witness to the story, instead of the actor in it.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Without remaining open to change , we can not remain open to life\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"The art of life is to stay wide open and be vulnerable, yet at the same time to sit with the mystery and the awe and with the unbearable pain - to just be with it all.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Suffering is part of our training program for becoming wise.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"The intellect is a beautiful servant but a terrible master. Intellect is the power tool of our separateness. The intuitive, compassionate heart is the doorway to our unity.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Everything in your life is there as a vehicle for your transformation. Use it!\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Let the natural flow of the universe, course through your being, and harmonize your soul.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"All that you seek is already within you. In Hinduism it is called the Atman, in Buddhism the pure Buddha-Mind. Christ said, 'the kingdom of heaven is within you.' Quakers call it the ‘still small voice within.’ This is the space of full awareness that is in harmony with all the universe, and thus is wisdom itself.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"If you think you’re enlightened go spend a week with your family.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"The universe is made up of experiences that are designed to burn out your attachment, your clinging, to pleasure, to pain, to fear, to all of it. And as long as there is a place where you’re vulnerable, the universe will find a way to confront you with it.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Nature is really important because it's a manifestation of love that hasn't been run through human minds.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"When you look back at your own life, you see ... the sufferings you went through, each time you would have avoided it if you possibly could.  And yet, when you look at the depth of your character now, isn't a part of that a product of those experiences?  Weren't those experiences part of what created the depth of your inner being?\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"The sooner one develops compassion in this journey, the better. Compassion lets us appreciate that each individual is doing what he or she must do, and that there is no reason to judge another person or oneself. You merely do what you can to further your own awakening.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"   
"\n\"As you dissolve into love, your ego fades. You’re not thinking about loving; you’re just being love, radiating like the sun.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed.\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~"
"\n\"Be Here Now\"\n\n ~ Ram Dass ~
"\n\"I've often said that the only thing I can change with magick is my­self. I believe that. Whatever changes I wish to effect with magick, the first and only thing that will be directly changed by my magical operation will be me. Once I am changed, then the new changed me will then somehow affect or attract the desired object of my opera­tion.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"It's all in your head -- you just have no idea how big your head is.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"Make no mistake about it, magick is an art form, and every true magician is an artist.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"If we can't wake up to the fact that deep down inside we are good, then we deserve to remain asleep dreaming we are evil.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"It is one thing to be well-read on a subject; it is quite another to be part of the subject itself. It is an unfortunate fact that there are many individuals who make magick there life without making their life magick.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"No matter what system the magician chooses, in order to make it work most effectively he or she must first become attuned to that system's particular way of viewing of the universe.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"
"\n\"In a world that’s gone hellishly mad we’ve always taken comfort in the fact that the faith of our fathers is the one thing that remains solid and unchanging. It occurs to very few of us that perhaps for the last 2,500 years the faith of our fathers has been one of the main reasons why our world has gone hellishly mad.\"\n\n ~ Lon Milo DuQuette ~"

"\n\"Love is what we are; we don't get it from somebody, we can't give it to anybody, we can't fall in it or fall out of it. Love is our true Being.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Chanting is a way of getting in touch with yourself. It's an opening of the heart and letting go of the mind and thoughts. It deepens the channel of grace, and it's a way of being present in the moment.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"The heart is like a mirror. When we dust it off, we are able to see ourselves. The dust is all our stuff - guilt, anger - this stuff is reflected back to us. Practice removes the dust from the mirror of our hearts.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Don't wait for a Guru. Your life is your Guru.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"We have to learn to love people even if they are not giving you what you want... and then not take it personally. If you feel hurt, you have to recognize that they are not hurting you because you are you, but because they are them. You have to try not to be so hard on yourself.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Devotion is a way of being, it's not something you do. It's dedication to finding awareness and Love. Chanting is like asanas for the mind and the heart.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"You cannot think your way out of a box made of thought.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Unlimited inner strength can only be awakened when it is in the service of Love....When we align ourselves with that love and act in service of that love, anything is possible.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"There is love in this world, and it lives within us as who we really are, not who we think we are.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"The ultimate act of power is surrender.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"We instantly believe everything we think. Isn't that insane? It's good for us to explore the depravity of our minds, so we know we are just as crazy as everyone else!\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Grace removes obstacles that we don’t even know are there. Grace is what arranges our lives so we are forced to look within.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Chanting just hits you and you want to be a part of it. That’s the point of this whole thing. That’s what cuts through all the ‘stuff’. You get lit up. You don’t have to know what it means.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"To love somebody is to let them be who they are and do what they have to do.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Practice is not about how you feel while you are doing it. You are planting seeds.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"I'm reconnecting, I'm deepening, I'm opening, I'm releasing negativity and negative thoughts and all the limitations I carry around with me - again and again and again and again and again and again. And again! And that's the only thing that keeps me alive.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Surrender happens by Grace. All we're doing is cleaning up the room so when Surrender walks in, He can sit down.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"Letting go does not mean pushing away or negating thoughts or feelings that come to us - but instead being with the feeling. We start to feel that we are no longer victims of the stuff that happens to us. There is something we can do about it... if we just take a look at it.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"
"\n\"The heart in us is deeper than any emotion or psychological issue.\"\n\n ~ Krishna Das ~"

"\n\"You are the universe experiencing itself.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"The future is a concept, it doesn't exist. There is no such thing as tomorrow. There never will be, because time is always now. That's one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking. We find there is only present, only an eternal now.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"Every explicit duality is an implicit unity.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"

"\n\"By going out of your mind, you come to your senses\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"Of course, you can’t force your mind to be silent. That would be like trying to smooth ripples in water with a flatiron. Water becomes clear and calm only when left alone.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"We see what we believe rather than what we see.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"

"\n\"You can make any human activity into meditation simply by being completely with it and doing it just to do it.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
"\n\"Don't hurry anything. Don't worry about the future. Don't worry about what progress you're making. Just be entirely content to be aware of what is.\"\n\n ~ Alan Watts ~"
